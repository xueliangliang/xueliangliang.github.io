        <h1>Why?</h1>
        <p>
        This website was originally made for an assignment my master course Master of Technology Management subject MT5003: Creativity and Innovation. 
        After starting this project, I found it was a good chance for me to retrospect my whole life and self-talked to myself with these questions:
        </p>
        <br/>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>W</strong>ho am I?</li>
            <li><strong>W</strong>here am I from?</li>
            <li><strong>W</strong>hat is my purpose of life?</li>
            <li><strong>W</strong>here am I going to be?</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>
        At my age (35 in Year 2016), I am not able to answer all these questions <strong>yet</strong>, but after MT5003's training for the whole course, I will continue this practice of retrospection and persist to pursue my true purpose of life.
